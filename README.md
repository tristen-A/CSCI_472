Ant script tasks are as follows;

--- 'ant clean': Cleans the "build" directory of the project.
--- 'ant compile': Compiles Java source files under demo/Core, demo/Database, and demo/Tests.
--- 'ant test': Runs JUnit test cases built under build/Tests. Creates Jacoco coverage documentation under build.
--- 'ant report': Compiles coverage documentation into a browser-viewable .html file under build/site/jacoco.

NOTE: This project is originally built in IntellIJ. IntellIJ project structure has been maintained for ease of development, but should not interfere with Ant automation.
